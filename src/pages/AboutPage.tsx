      <p>Hello there! I'm Lester â€” a student, a software engineer, and a hobbyist photographer, based in Singapore.</p>
      <p>
        This website serves to bring together my passion in software development and photography. With almost a
        decade of event photography experience, I have photographed many events, most recently the Children Cancer
        Foundation's Survivors Day 2023.
